## Description

CATasTROPHY is an interactive 2D platformer game, where you play as a small character on their way to rescue stranded cats.
Move with your keyboard and jump with your voice as you avoid the dangerous obstacles blocking your way !! No worries if you die : try your luck at the slot machine of fate, and who knows, you might get a second chance !

The world displayed on the screen is horizontal and linear, and the camera follows the player. To move to the left or to the right, simply press the left and right arrows on your keyboard. To jump, the player has to say the word “jump” (or press on the up arrow) : the system will detect the word and react accordingly.
Falling, as well as the minor obstacles blocking the way (e.g. spikes, canons…) will provide damage to the player’s health : if it falls down to 0, a second chance is given and a slot machine appears on-screen. With a simple drag motion performed with the mouse, the player can then pull the lever down and gamble for another chance! If lucky enough, all the health gets restored and the level continues right where it stopped; if not, it’s game over and the player is sent back to the beginning.
Avoid obstacles and finish the level to claim your cat as a trophy !
